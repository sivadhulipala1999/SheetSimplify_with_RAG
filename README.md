# SheetSimplify with RAG LLMs 
The aim of this project is to simplify data retrieval from Excel Sheets using RAG LLMs, hence the name! Many organizations currently store their data in Excel sheets and have stored decades' worth of data in them. However, retrieving data from these sheets becomes quite difficult unless the user has some technical background. The idea of Natural Language Querying (NLQ) is to exactly solve this issue by allowing users to ask simple questions to a model and get appropriate and rational responses. This NLQ can be achieved using RAG LLMs, which is what we aim to build in this project.
